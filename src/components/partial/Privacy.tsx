        eGov PH Super App is a platform developed by SuperAppTeam that is designed to address and
        enrich the day-to-day needs and wants of our customers. The eGov PH Super App features
        online government services which may be availed of by the general public - one of which is
        “Start-Up”.
      </p>
      <p className='text-justify'>
        "Start-Up" facilitates connectivity between startup companies/business and government
        agencies. This is an avenue for potential business partnerships. Users can showcase their
        startups by simply applying through this platform - which only needs their basic business
        information and a presentation. Overall, Start-Up offers the users an efficient and
        effective means of promoting their businesses to government agencies, ultimately expanding
        their professional network.
